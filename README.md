# ChaosCampaignGenerator
A Mercenary Contract generator for a BattleTech Chaos Campaign.  
Rules for generating contracts can be found in "BattleTech: Hot Spots: Hinterlands"

# How to Use
Download the ChasCampaignGenerator.exe file from Releases then execute the program. You will be prompted for the number of contracts you wish to generate. The contracts are generated in pairs, the Primary Contract and the Opposing Contract. Along with the Contrat Terms the generator will also generate the number and type of Tracks along with who is the Attacker and Defender for the Contract.

# Features and Roadmap
The current release has the basic functionality of creating a random contract based on the rules in "BattleTech: Hot Spots: Hinterlands". For every contract you request to generate it will generate a Primary and an Opposing Contract. At the moment there is no build in fluff, so for Employers it will generate something like "House Government" and not "Federated Suns".

## Roadmap
* Generate Command Complications based on type of Contract, Primary Terrain, and Employer
* Options for increasing intensity of a contract
* Fluff
  * Specific canon/non-canon Employers for the different Houses, nobles, corporations, mercenaries, and civilian organizations
  * More specific locations beyond primary terrain.
